# Green Coffee Bean Grading Feature

## Overview

The Green Coffee Bean Grading feature allows users to grade green (unroasted) coffee beans according to professional standards, primarily the SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) grading system. This feature helps coffee professionals assess the quality of green coffee beans before roasting.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented (Phase 1 & 2)

1. **SCA Grading System**
   - Primary defects (Category 1) counting
   - Secondary defects (Category 2) counting
   - Automatic full defect equivalent calculation
   - Grade classification (Specialty, Premium, Exchange, Below Standard)

2. **Defect Calculator**
   - Interactive defect entry with type selection
   - Real-time calculation of full defect equivalents
   - Visual grade classification with color coding
   - Support for multiple defect types per category

3. **Additional Quality Assessments**
   - Moisture content (% with ideal range 10-12%)
   - Water activity (aw value with ideal range 0.55-0.65)
   - Bulk density (g/L)
   - Color score (1-10 scale)
   - Uniformity score (1-10 scale)

4. **Quality Score Calculation**
   - Automatic calculation based on all factors
   - 0-100 scale
   - Considers defects, moisture, water activity, color, and uniformity

5. **User Interface**
   - Tab-based interface in sample detail page
   - Intuitive defect entry with add/remove functionality
   - Visual grade badges and indicators
